# Password-Safe-v.086
  This is a localized password safe meant for anyone who wants strong passwords but also has trouble remembering them. All information is stored on the users hard drive. The project is not yet complete, much of the code needs to be commented and streamlined. The next step is to have the folder store and read from JSON files instead of plain text.

  This project uses Crypto, pyperclip and bcrypt external libraries.
